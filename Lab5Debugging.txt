1. Describe the reason the program goes into endless loop, under what kind of user
input? - A string is used as the input, 
        the endless loop was caused by not clearing the fail state. 

2. When the program goes into endless loop, what is the value of
input_to_check? - 

3. Provide your solution. (either by coding statement or by description)
    SOLUTION: I fixed the variable on line 151 in Lab5.cpp to match the .begin() 
    and .end() methods as seen in: "coactors.begin(); ia != coactors.end()". 
    Additionally, I cleared the fail state after the input validation stage, 
    as well as made it return 0 instead of just breaking inside the if statement
    if "Q" or "q" was entered. Now it functions properly and exits the 
    program as intended.
